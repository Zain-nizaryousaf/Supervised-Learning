# Breast Cancer Classification

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the implementation and comparison of five classification algorithms on the breast cancer dataset from sklearn.

## Algorithms Implemented
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Classifier**
3. **Random Forest Classifier**
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
5. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy comparison of different algorithms

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`).
3. Open this notebook and run the cells to explore the implementation and results.

## Results
The notebook includes accuracy metrics for each model, highlighting the best and worst performers in the classification task.
